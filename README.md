## Installation

You have a one click installation for free in heroku, clicking the "deploy to heroku" button in this page.
If you want to use it on-premise, follow this steps:

- MongoDB is needed
- NodeJS is needed
- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install` to download dependencies
- Modify the .env at the root to point to your database (you have a .envexample you can use)
- Modify the .env at the client folder to point to the url and port of your backend
- Run `npm start` at the root folder
- Run `npm start` at the client folder (This step is OPTIONAL. Run if you want to make change in the front-end )

If you want to generate a production version, run `npm run build` at the client folder and copy the build contents to the public folder.

### Running in a different port

Example of application running in port 3010:

./.env

```shell
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/nlpjs
LOG_LEVEL=debug
PORT=3010
```

./client/.env

```shell
SETTINGS_URL=http://localhost:3010
API_URL=http://localhost:3010
PUBLIC_PATH_PREFIX=
```

Then, replace "public" folder content:

```shell
cd client
npm run build
cd ..
mv public public_old
mv client/build public
npm start
```

## Example of use

You can create an agent:

![Create agent](./screenshots/create-agent.png)

Then create at least one domain:

![Create domain](./screenshots/create-domain.png)

Create some entities if you need them:

![Create entity](./screenshots/create-entity.png)

Create some intents:

![Create intent](./screenshots/create-intent.png)

Train and test:

![Train](./screenshots/train.png)

### Slot filling

It's also possible to check required entities within an intent.

Example of basic slot filling:

![Basic slot filling](./screenshots/slot-filling.png)

Example of multiple slot filling used in the same intent:

![Multiple slot filling](./screenshots/slot-filling-2.png)

## Docker Compose

A docker-compose receipt is available to allow a quick-start easily. Just execute:

**Start:**

```docker
docker-compose up
```

**Start detached:**

```docker
docker-compose up -d
```

**Stop:**

```docker
docker-compose down
```

It will start the Mongo database, [NLP.js](http://localhost:3000 "NLP.js app at localhost") application and a [Mongo Express](http://localhost:8081 "Mongo-Express at localhost") to allow inspect the collections.

### Little disclaimer

Consider the changes you may apply in the configuration as outlined in point [Installation](#installation) and take in mind the behaviour of Docker Compose as exposed in <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#env_file>
